        <p>To work with <span class="MyVariablesQuadD">NVIDIA System Profiler</span>, the target Android device should be
configured for <strong>USB debugging</strong> in the <strong>Developer options</strong> settings menu.  Please
refer to Android development documentation to learn how to configure the device
for USB debugging.</p>
        <p>On the Windows host, a compatible USB driver should be installed.
Please refer to device manufacturer's documentation to learn how to obtain and
install the driver.</p>
        <p>Connect your target device via a USB cable and power it on (or wake it up).  Make
sure that you have the <code>adb</code> command available (it is part of Android SDK Platform
Tools package).  <span class="MyVariablesQuadD">NVIDIA System Profiler</span> can only connect to devices that are
marked as <code>device</code> in the output of the <code>adb devices</code> command.  Make sure you can
enter the ADB shell of the target device by running <code>adb shell</code> on the host.</p>
        <p>Launch the <span class="MyVariablesQuadD">NVIDIA System Profiler</span> application.  On the first launch, a new project
called <code>Project 1</code> is created automatically.</p>
        <blockquote>

            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>When connecting to the target device, <span class="MyVariablesQuadD">NVIDIA System Profiler</span> will validate it and
install its daemon into the following location on the device:</p>
        <blockquote><pre class="prettyprint">/data/local/tmp/com.nvidia.tegraprofiler.tools/
</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once the daemon and all required files are installed correctly, a green check
mark will appear and <code>Device is ready</code> text will be displayed:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <img alt="Device is ready" src="../3.9-automotive/img/device-is-ready.png" title="" />

        <p><strong>Trace all processes</strong> — on compatible devices (with kernel module support
version 1.107 or higher), enables trace of all processes and threads in the 
system.  Scheduler events from all tasks will be recorded.</p>
        <p><strong>Collect PMU counters</strong> allows to choose which ARM PMU (Performance
Monitoring Unit) counters <span class="MyVariablesQuadD">NVIDIA System Profiler</span> will sample.  Enable specific
counters when interested in correlating cache misses to functions in your
application.</p>
        <h2 id="h-eb762-2">Target Sampling Options</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <img alt="Target sampling options" src="../3.9-automotive/img/target-sampling-options.png" title="" />
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Currently <span class="MyVariablesQuadD">NVIDIA System Profiler</span> can only sample one process.  Sampling here means
that the profilee will be stopped periodically, and backtraces of active threads
will be recorded.</p>
        <p><strong>Sampling rate</strong> defines how often the profilee will be interrupted in order to
collect backtraces.  This option has to be used carefully: perfect value depends
on many factors.</p>
        <p>Low sampling rate requires longer profiling session to produce statistically
significant information.  This is especially important when additional
time-based filtering is then applied in the report view to analyze smaller
periods of time.</p>
        <p>High sampling rate, on the other hand, produces higher overhead.  For some
applications, it might hide performance issues related to waiting other work to
complete, such as waiting to acquire mutex locks, waiting for GPU
synchronization or waiting for network or disk-based IO to complete.</p>
        <p>In some cases, forcing to use frame pointers as unwind algorithm is a viable
option to reduce performance overhead.  Unwind (backtracing) algorithms can be
configured using the <strong>Choose modes...</strong> button.</p>
        <p>Most applications use stripped libraries.  In this case, many symbols may stay
unresolved.  If unstripped libraries exist, paths to them can be specified using
the <strong>Symbol locations...</strong> button.  Symbol resolution happens on host, and
therefore does not affect performance of profiling on the target.</p>
        <p>Additionally, debug versions of ELF files may be picked up from the target 
system.  Refer to the corresponding section of the documentation.</p>
        <p>This sections allows you to choose which application to profile.  All information
will be collected about the main process of the selected application, except
when the <strong>Trace all processes</strong> checkbox is enabled.</p>
        <p>For non-rooted Android devices, the list of applications only shows information
about debuggable applications.  By default, applications that are being
developed using the Android SDK already contain the debuggable option in their
manifests.</p>
        <p>On rooted Android devices, profiling of all applications is allowed.</p>
        <p>For convenience, the application list also shows the process identifiers (PID)
of processes correlated to the listed packages.  To refresh this information,
use the button in the upper right corner of the list.</p>
        <p>The two checkboxes below the application list are important to ensure that the 
correct launch or attach behavior is configured.</p>
        <p><strong>Allow sending intent to launch the default activity</strong>, when unselected, forces
the profiler to attach to a running process.  If no processes are found to
correlate to the specified application name, the profiling session fails to start
with an error message.  When selected, <span class="MyVariablesQuadD">NVIDIA System Profiler</span> may launch the
default intent of the selected application to make sure it is running and
appears on top of the screen on the target device.</p>
        <p>In some applications, especially in early stages of development, common bugs
related to handling the lifecycle of activities can be found.  In such cases,
sending the default intent may lead to undesired behavior or even crashes of the
profilee.  Leaving the checkbox unselected ensures that the profiler does not
affect the application.</p>
        <p><strong>Restart application if running</strong> is a convenient option in two cases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>When profiling from the very beginning of the application is desired.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>When using some of the trace features described below.  They require that a
special library is injected into the application in runtime, which happens
when the application is paused by the Android runtime's virtual machine just
after starting.  In this case, enabling this option helps ensure that the
application is always restarted and the injection always happens, as opposed
to potentially attaching to the application's process without injection.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
